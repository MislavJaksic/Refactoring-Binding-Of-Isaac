## Refactoring Binding Of Isaac

After reading the book [Clean Code](https://github.com/MislavJaksic/KnowledgeRepository/tree/master/QualityCode) again, I've decided to put the principles of the book into practice.

Of all the programs I chould have chosen to refactor, I've picked a video game, written in pure JavaScript that
was modeled after a video game called Binding of Isaac. I've chosen this patricular program because during the
course of the project, I'll learn JavaScript as well.
