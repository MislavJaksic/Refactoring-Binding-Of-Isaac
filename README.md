## Refactoring Binding Of Isaac

After reading [Clean Code](https://github.com/MislavJaksic/KnowledgeRepository/tree/master/QualityCode) by Robert C. Martin again, I thought it would be an entertaining and quite useful side
project to rewrite another programmer's code so that it follows the principles laid out in the book.

Of all the programs I could have chosen to refactor, I've picked a video game, written in pure JavaScript,
constructed by Filip Petrina ([LinkedIn Profile](https://hr.linkedin.com/in/filip-petrina-5898ba149/hr)) which is modeled after another video game called "Binding of Isaac".
I've chosen this particular program because of the following: while refactoring the code I'll learn more about the
HTML/CSS/JS web triumvirate, something I wanted to learn for a long time; the code is readily available to me, just
stored in one of my folders; after working on business and academia projects, I wanted respite, to work on a more
lighthearted project.


### Original

Contains the original work, as presented to me. To complete the undergraduate studies, it is common practice that
a student should show what they have learned at the university by making a final project. This is Filip's final
project, a Binding of Isaac inspired game made in pure JavaScript and HTML.


### Rework

Contains the refactoring journal where I analyse the program, explain what I'm thinking and detail how I'll
refactor the code.
