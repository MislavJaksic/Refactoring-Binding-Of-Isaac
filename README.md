## Refactoring Binding Of Isaac

After reading [Clean Code](https://github.com/MislavJaksic/KnowledgeRepository/tree/master/QualityCode) by Robert C. Martin again, I thought it would be an entertaining and quite useful side
project to rewrite another programmer's code so that it follows the principles laid out in the book.

Of all the programs I chould have chosen to refactor, I've picked a video game, written in pure JavaScript,
constructed by Filip Petrina ([LinkedIn Profile](https://hr.linkedin.com/in/filip-petrina-5898ba149/hr)) which be modeled after another video game called "Binding of Isaac".
I've chosen this patricular program because of the following: while refactoring the code I'll learn more about the
HTML/CSS/JS web triumvirate, something I wanted to learn for a long time; the code is readily available to me, just
stored in one of my folders; after working on business and acedemia projects, I wanted respite, to work on a more
lighthearted project.
